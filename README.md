# Introduction

This repository contains functions and notebooks that allow the user to perform a mean square displacement analysis on single particle trajectories. 

# Contents

* `Notebook_for_1_dataset.ipynb` is perfect when one wants to process data without worrying about comparing it with another dataset. Once the `DataFrame` is built, it is recommended to look for clusters in the &alpha-D plane. Varying some key parameters for the analysis (number of points for the fit of the MSDs, minimum number of frames for the trajectories...) might be necessary. 
* `Notebook_for_2_dataset.ipynb`, on the other hand, is good to compare the outcome between two experiments or when we vary some parameters.
